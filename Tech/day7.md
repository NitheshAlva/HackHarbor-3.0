# Internship Syllabus: Generative AI, LLM APIs, Prompt Engineering & AI Tools  
_For 2nd Year Engineering Students_

---

## 1. Introduction to Generative AI
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **What is Generative AI?**  
  Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content—like text, images, and code—based on the examples it has learned. Think of it as AI that can “create” rather than just “predict.”
- **Differences between traditional AI and LLMs:**  
  Traditional AI focuses on specific tasks, like detecting spam or recommending products, while LLMs (Large Language Models) are designed to understand and generate human-like language.
- **Real-world uses of generative AI:**  
  Examples include:
  - Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT)
  - AI tools for writing essays or generating code
  - AI creating images or designs for creative projects

## 2. LLM APIs and Usage
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **What is an API?**  
  An API is like a “messenger” that lets your app talk to AI models. It’s how you send questions (prompts) to the AI and get answers back.
- **Why use APIs for AI/LLM access?**  
  APIs let you use powerful AI without needing to install or train it yourself. They’re easy to integrate into apps.
- **Popular LLM APIs:**  
  You’ll explore APIs like:
  - OpenAI (used for ChatGPT)
  - Ollama (for locally hosted models)
  - HuggingFace (a hub for AI models)
  - Cohere (for language tasks)
- **Setting up and calling an LLM API:**  
  Hands-on practice to learn:
  - Setting up API keys
  - Writing code to send prompts to the AI
  - Understanding how the AI responds
- **Authentication, request/response basics:**  
  Learn how to securely connect to APIs using keys and how to format your requests.

## 3. Self-Hosting and Local LLMs
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **Tools for running LLMs locally:**  
  Discover tools like Ollama that let you run AI models on your own computer. This is helpful for privacy-focused work or when internet access is limited.
- **Running LLMs on your own device:**  
  Learn the process of downloading and setting up models like Llama on your laptop or PC.
- **Pros and cons of self-hosted vs. cloud APIs:**  
  - **Self-hosted:** More control, no internet required, but needs powerful hardware.
  - **Cloud APIs:** Easier to use, but requires internet and may involve costs.

## 4. Prompt Engineering Basics
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **What is a prompt?**  
  A prompt is the instruction you give to the AI to get the answer you want. For example: “Write a poem about summer.”
- **How LLMs use prompts:**  
  Learn how the AI “reads” your prompt and uses it to generate responses.
- **Tips for writing effective prompts:**  
  Find out how to ask clear, specific questions to get better answers.

## 5. Prompting Tips & Tricks
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **Role prompting:**  
  Ask the AI to take on a role, like: “Act as a teacher and explain Newton’s laws.”
- **Chain-of-thought prompting:**  
  Encourage the AI to break down tasks step-by-step for detailed answers.
- **Prompt templates:**  
  Use pre-made templates for tasks like summarizing articles or generating code.
- **Few-shot vs. zero-shot prompting:**  
  - **Few-shot prompting:** Give examples in your prompt to guide the AI.
  - **Zero-shot prompting:** Simply ask the AI without examples.
- **Common mistakes to avoid:**  
  Learn what NOT to do, like being too vague or asking contradictory questions.

## 6. Useful AI Tools & Websites (By Task)
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **Frontend/UI Design:**  
  Tools like:
  - [Lovable](https://www.lovable.so): Generate UI components easily.
  - [V0](https://v0.dev): Create React code from simple prompts.
  - [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com): Build app backends using AI.
- **Chatbots & Coding:**  
  Use tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude to create chatbots and write code.
- **Writing Assistance:**  
  Tools like Jasper and GrammarlyGO help improve your essays and writing style.
- **Code Generation:**  
  Tools like SourceAI and GitHub Copilot turn your natural language instructions into working code.
- **Image Generation:**  
  Create images using DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion.
- **Summarization:**  
  Tools like QuillBot and SMMRY make it easy to summarize long documents.
- **Evaluating tools:**  
  Learn how to pick the best tools for your needs and avoid scams or unreliable AI websites.

## 7. Good Models vs. Bad Models (Task-Specific)
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **Best models for specific tasks:**  
  Match models to tasks:
  - GPT-4: Great for coding, writing, and problem-solving.
  - Gemini: Good for general-purpose tasks and integrating search.
  - Claude: Safe for long-context tasks like summarization.
  - Llama: Best for private or offline use.
- **Limitations of models:**  
  Understand why some models are not suitable for certain tasks (e.g., hallucinations or inaccurate results).

## 8. Responsible AI Use
**What You’ll Learn:**
- **Limitations and risks of LLMs:**  
  Learn why AI sometimes makes mistakes, like generating biased or incorrect answers.
- **Bias and misinformation in AI:**  
  Understand how biases in training data can affect what the AI generates.
- **Legal and ethical considerations:**  
  Explore the rules for using AI responsibly, including copyright concerns and privacy.
- **Citing AI-generated content:**  
  Learn how to properly credit AI when you use it in your projects or assignments.
