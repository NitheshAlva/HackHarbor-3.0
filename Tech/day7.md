# Internship Syllabus: Generative AI, LLM APIs, Prompt Engineering & AI Tools  
_For 2nd Year Engineering Students_

---

## 1. Introduction to Generative AI
- What is Generative AI?
- Differences between traditional AI and LLMs
- Real-world uses of generative AI

## 2. LLM APIs and Usage
- What is an API?
- Why use APIs for AI/LLM access?
- Popular LLM APIs: OpenAI, Ollama, HuggingFace, Cohere, etc.
- Setting up and calling an LLM API (sample code/demo)
- Authentication, request/response basics

## 3. Self-Hosting and Local LLMs
- Tools for running LLMs locally (e.g., Ollama)
- Running LLMs on your own device
- Pros and cons of self-hosted vs. cloud APIs

## 4. Prompt Engineering Basics
- What is a prompt?
- How LLMs use prompts
- Tips for writing effective prompts

## 5. Prompting Tips & Tricks
- Role prompting (e.g., "Act as a teacher")
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Prompt templates
- Few-shot vs. zero-shot prompting
- Common mistakes to avoid

## 6. Useful AI Tools & Websites (By Task)
- Find websites and tools that excel at specific tasks:
    - **Frontend/UI:** [Lovable](https://www.lovable.so), [V0](https://v0.dev), [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com)
    - **Chatbots/Coding:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude, etc.
    - **Writing:** AI writing assistants (e.g., Jasper, GrammarlyGO)
    - **Code generation:** SourceAI, GitHub Copilot
    - **Image generation:** DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion
    - **Summarization:** QuillBot, SMMRY
- How to identify good AI tools and avoid scams

## 7. Good Models vs. Bad Models (Task-Specific)
- Which LLMs/models are best for different tasks (e.g., coding, writing, math, Q&A, summarization)
    - Examples:
        - GPT-4 for advanced text, coding, reasoning
        - Gemini for general purpose and search integration
        - Claude for safe, long-context use
        - Llama models for local/basic use
- Limitations of some models for specific tasks

## 8. Responsible AI Use
- Limitations and risks of LLMs
- Bias and misinformation in AI
- Legal and ethical considerations
- Citing AI-generated content

## 9. Mini Project / Hands-On
- Build a simple app/demo using an LLM API
- Prompt engineering challenge

## 10. Q&A & Further Resources
- Career opportunities in AI/ML
- Where to learn more (MOOCs, YouTube, GitHub, etc.)
- Open Q&A
