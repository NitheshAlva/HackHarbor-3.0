## 1️⃣ Introduction to Generative AI

### What You’ll Learn
- **Definition:**  
  Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models designed to *generate* new content—such as text, images, music, or even computer code—by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which typically classifies or recommends, generative models are creators.
- **Examples in Action:**  
  - **ChatGPT:** Generates human-like text responses in conversation  
  - **DALL·E / Midjourney:** Create unique images or digital art from text prompts  
  - **GitHub Copilot:** Assists programmers by generating code snippets based on context
- **Traditional AI vs. LLMs:**  
  - *Traditional AI* relies on specific rules and decision trees (e.g., spam detection, pattern recognition).
  - *LLMs (Large Language Models)*, like GPT-4 or Llama2, are trained on vast datasets to understand and generate natural language, making them highly flexible for a range of creative tasks.
- **Applications in Industry:**  
  - **Education:** Automated essay writing, personalized tutoring, language learning assistants  
  - **Design:** Rapid prototyping, generating illustrations or UI mockups  
  - **Development:** Code generation, bug detection, code explanation, and documentation

🛠️ **Activity:**  
**Group Discussion:**  
Ask students to think about and share at least three AI-powered tools or features they've interacted with recently (e.g., YouTube's video recommendations, Siri or Alexa voice assistants, Grammarly's writing suggestions, Netflix recommendations, etc.).

## 2️⃣ LLM APIs and Usage

### What You’ll Learn
- **What is an API?**  
  An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a messenger that enables different software applications to communicate. When working with LLMs, APIs allow your code or application to send questions (prompts) to a model hosted in the cloud and receive responses.
- **Why APIs are Useful:**  
  - **No need for advanced infrastructure:** Leverage powerful AI models without training them from scratch.
  - **Easy integration:** Plug AI capabilities into web or mobile apps with minimal code.
  - **Scalability:** Access up-to-date, state-of-the-art models maintained by experts.
- **Popular LLM APIs:**  
  - **OpenAI API (ChatGPT, GPT-4):** Text, code, and image generation  
  - **HuggingFace Inference API:** Open-source models for text, translation, summarization, and more  
  - **Cohere API:** Specialized in language tasks like classification, summarization, and search  
  - **Ollama:** For running models like Llama and Mistral locally on your own machine
- **Basics of API Requests:**  
  - **HTTP Methods:** Most common are `POST` (sending data) and `GET` (retrieving data)
  - **Authentication:** APIs typically require an API key to ensure only authorized users can access them.
  - **JSON Payloads:** Data sent to and received from APIs is usually formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

🛠️ **Activity:**  
**Hands-On Demo:**  
Guide students through sending a simple prompt to the OpenAI API using Python or Postman.  
Example prompt:  
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Give me a fun fact about space."}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
Or, using Postman, send a POST request to the OpenAI endpoint with a JSON body.

  - At least **8 GB RAM** is recommended; more is better, especially for larger models.
  - While CPUs can work, a **GPU** significantly improves speed and can handle larger models (3B–13B parameters).
- **Comparison Table:**  

  | Feature         | Self-Hosted                 | Cloud/API               |
  |-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
  | Privacy         | ✅ Complete local control   | ❌ Data may be logged   |
  | Setup Effort    | 🛠️ Higher (install, config) | 🔌 Minimal setup        |
  | Cost            | 💸 One-time hardware/power  | 💸 Ongoing per-use fee  |
  | Speed           | ⚡ Fast (no network lag)    | 🌐 Depends on internet  |

🛠️ **Activity:**  
**Live Demo:**  
Show how to run Llama2 locally using Ollama:  
```shell
ollama run llama2
```
Ask the model: “Give me a motivational quote to start my day!”

## 4️⃣ Prompt Engineering Basics

### What You’ll Learn
- **What is a Prompt?**  
  A *prompt* is a carefully constructed input or instruction given to an LLM to guide it in generating a desired output.  
  _Example: “Write a short story about a robot learning to cook.”_
- **Prompting is Programming:**  
  Instead of giving code, you use clear, natural language instructions to “program” the AI’s response.
- **Writing Effective Prompts:**  
  - **Be clear and specific:** Avoid vague instructions.
  - **Set context:** Use roles or scenarios (e.g., “You are a Java teacher…”).
  - **Specify format:** Ask for output in a particular structure (e.g., “Answer in bullet points”).

🛠️ **Activity:**  
**Prompt Rewriting:**  
Take a vague prompt like “Tell me about AI” and rephrase it into three improved prompts, such as:
1. “Explain the difference between traditional AI and generative AI in simple terms.”
2. “List three real-world applications of AI in healthcare.”
3. “Describe how AI can help automate daily tasks, using examples.”

## 5️⃣ Prompting Tips & Tricks

### What You’ll Learn
- **Role Prompting:**  
  Assign a persona—e.g., “You are a chef. Give me a recipe for biryani.” The model responds as a chef.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**  
  Encourage stepwise reasoning—e.g., “Explain how to sort a list using bubble sort, step by step.”
- **Prompt Templates:**  
  Use reusable scaffolds for common tasks:
  - “Summarize this article in 3 lines.”
  - “Convert this text into an email.”
  - “Explain this code in simple terms.”
- **Few-Shot Prompting:**  
  Provide a few examples in the prompt so the model learns your preferred style or format.
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**  
  - Vague or ambiguous queries
  - Giving conflicting instructions in the same prompt
  - Asking for too many tasks at once (overloading the model)

🛠️ **Activity:**  
**Design Exercise:**  
Create a few-shot prompt for the task: “Convert text into tweet-sized facts.”  
_Example:_
```
Convert the following facts into tweets:
Fact: The honeybee is the only insect that produces food eaten by humans.
Tweet: Did you know? The honeybee is the only insect that makes food for humans! 🍯 #FunFact
Fact: Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't.
Tweet: Mind blown! Bananas are technically berries, but strawberries aren't! 🍌🍓 #DidYouKnow
Now, convert: Dolphins sleep with one eye open.
```
