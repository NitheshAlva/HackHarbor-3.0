## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Generative AI

### **Definition**
Generative AI is a rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence focused on creating new and original content, rather than simply analyzing or categorizing existing information. These AI models are trained on large datasets‚Äîsuch as books, images, music, or code‚Äîand learn patterns, styles, and structures within the data. This enables them to generate entirely new outputs that resemble the examples they were trained on.  
- **Key Point:** Unlike traditional AI, which is primarily used to sort, label, or recommend based on pre-learned rules, generative AI acts as a ‚Äúcreator,‚Äù capable of inventing new text, images, music, and more.

For example, generative AI can:
- Write a poem or story in the style of Shakespeare
- Generate a photorealistic image of a ‚Äúcat wearing sunglasses in space‚Äù
- Compose a new melody similar to your favorite artist
- Suggest original code for a programming problem

---

### **Examples in Action**

- **ChatGPT:**  
  An advanced conversational AI that can answer questions, write essays, summarize texts, draft emails, tutor students, or even role-play as various professionals. It produces human-like text responses, maintaining context and adapting to the conversation.
  
- **DALL¬∑E / Midjourney:**  
  State-of-the-art image generators. You can give a prompt like ‚ÄúA futuristic city at sunset, painted in the style of Van Gogh,‚Äù and these models will create a unique image matching your description. They are used for digital art, design inspiration, and creative brainstorming.

- **GitHub Copilot:**  
  An AI-powered coding assistant that ‚Äúreads‚Äù your code in real time and offers context-aware suggestions‚Äîcompleting lines, generating functions, or even writing documentation. It boosts productivity and helps programmers learn new languages or frameworks more efficiently.

---

### **Traditional AI vs. LLMs**

- **Traditional AI:**
  - Based on strict rules, logic, and decision trees (‚Äúif this, then that‚Äù statements).
  - Common for tasks like spam detection, face recognition, or recommending products.
  - Good at yes/no decisions or sorting/classifying data, but not at creating new things.
  - Example: A spam filter uses keywords and sender info to mark emails as spam.
  
- **LLMs (Large Language Models):**
  - Examples: GPT-4, Llama2, Claude.
  - Trained on massive datasets (books, websites, code, etc.) to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù the structure and meaning of language.
  - Can generate paragraphs of text, answer complex questions, write stories, explain concepts, translate languages, and more.
  - More flexible and creative than traditional AI, able to adapt to a wide variety of tasks and contexts without explicit programming.

---

### **Applications in Industry**

- **Education:**
  - Automated essay writing/grading‚Äîsaves teachers time and offers instant feedback to students.
  - Personalized tutoring‚Äîadapts explanations based on student level.
  - Language learning‚Äîconverses in different languages, corrects grammar, and provides explanations.

- **Design:**
  - Rapid prototyping‚Äîquickly generates drafts for websites, apps, or graphics.
  - Creating unique illustrations or branding materials from text prompts.
  - Ideation‚Äîbrainstorms design ideas or color schemes.

- **Development:**

  - Bug detection‚Äîscans code for potential errors and offers fixes.
  - Code explanation‚Äîbreaks down complex code into simple language.
  - Automatic documentation‚Äîgenerates docstrings, README files, and usage guides.

- **Other Sectors (optional for extra depth):**
  - **Healthcare:** Assists in drafting patient notes, generating reports, or even proposing possible diagnoses.
  - **Entertainment:** Writes scripts, generates game dialogue, or creates music.
  - **Business:** Drafts marketing copy, summarizes customer feedback, or automates report writing.

---

**Summary:**  
Generative AI is revolutionizing multiple industries by introducing tools that can create, not just analyze. Its ability to produce human-like text, images, and even code is opening up new possibilities for creativity, productivity, and personalized experiences.
üõ†Ô∏è **Activity:**  
**Group Discussion:**  
Ask students to think about and share at least three AI-powered tools or features they've interacted with recently (e.g., YouTube's video recommendations, Siri or Alexa voice assistants, Grammarly's writing suggestions, Netflix recommendations, etc.).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LLM APIs and Usage

### What You‚Äôll Learn

---

#### **What is an API?**
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software programs to communicate with each other. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant: you (the user) tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and the waiter brings your request to the kitchen (the AI model in the cloud) and then delivers the result back to you. 

When using LLMs (Large Language Models), APIs let you send prompts or questions from your app or script to a powerful AI model hosted remotely (like on OpenAI‚Äôs servers) and get back answers or generated content. You don‚Äôt need to worry about how the model works on the inside‚Äîyou just send your input and receive the output.

---

#### **Why APIs are Useful**
- **No Need for Advanced Infrastructure:**  
  You don‚Äôt need a supercomputer or specialized hardware. All the complex computation is done in the cloud by the API provider. You just make requests from your laptop or even your phone.
- **Easy Integration:**  
  APIs can be easily added to your web or mobile applications with just a few lines of code. This means you can bring AI-powered features (like chatbots, summarizers, translators, etc.) to your projects quickly and efficiently.
- **Scalability:**  
  Since the models are hosted by organizations like OpenAI or HuggingFace, you can access the newest, most powerful models without managing updates or maintenance. As your app grows, the API provider handles more requests automatically.

**Examples:**
- A website that lets users ask questions about their homework can send those questions to the OpenAI API and instantly get answers.
- A mobile app for travelers could use an API to translate text or generate travel tips.

---

#### **Popular LLM APIs**

- **OpenAI API (ChatGPT, GPT-4):**  
  Widely used for generating text (stories, code, answers, summaries) and even creating images (with DALL¬∑E). Supports advanced features like conversation memory and function calling.
- **HuggingFace Inference API:**  
  Offers a huge collection of open-source models for tasks like translation, summarization, question answering, and more. Great for experimenting with different models and languages.
- **Cohere API:**  
  Focused on language tasks such as text classification, summarization, sentiment analysis, and semantic search. Known for enterprise and research use cases.
- **Ollama:**  
  Lets you run large language models (like Llama, Mistral) directly on your own device for privacy and offline use. Not a cloud API, but still uses an API interface locally.

---

#### **Basics of API Requests**

- **HTTP Methods:**  
  - `POST`: Most common for LLMs. You send your prompt or data to the API‚Äôs endpoint, and the model processes it and returns a result.
  - `GET`: Mainly used when you want to retrieve information without changing anything on the server. Less common for LLM tasks.
- **Authentication:**  
  APIs require an API key‚Äîa unique secret code you get when you sign up. This key is sent with every request to prove that you are authorized and to track your usage (preventing abuse and protecting your data).
- **JSON Payloads:**  
  Both the prompt you send and the response you get are formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is a lightweight, human-readable way to exchange data. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a fun fact about space."}
    ]
  }
  ```
  The API will return a JSON response with the generated answer.

---

**Summary:**  
APIs are the bridge that lets your apps and scripts communicate with powerful AI models in the cloud. By understanding how to use them, you can easily add advanced language, code, or image generation features to your projects without needing deep AI expertise or expensive hardware.

üõ†Ô∏è **Activity:**  
**Hands-On Demo:**  
Guide students through sending a simple prompt to the OpenAI API using Python or Postman.  
Example prompt:  
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Give me a fun fact about space."}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
Or, using Postman, send a POST request to the OpenAI endpoint with a JSON body.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Hosting and Local LLMs

### What You‚Äôll Learn

---

#### **Why Run LLMs Locally?**

- **Privacy:**  
  Running LLMs on your own computer means your data never leaves your device. Unlike cloud services where your input and output could potentially be stored or analyzed by a third party, local hosting ensures that sensitive information‚Äîlike proprietary code, confidential documents, or private conversations‚Äîremains completely under your control.

- **Offline Access:**  
  Local models don‚Äôt require an internet connection. This is especially valuable in environments with unreliable or no internet (e.g., remote areas, secure labs, or during travel). You can continue using powerful AI features anywhere, anytime.

- **Customization:**  
  When you host a model yourself, you have the freedom to configure its settings, update the model, or even fine-tune it for specialized tasks. This can be crucial for advanced users or organizations with unique needs, as you‚Äôre not limited by the constraints of a commercial API.

---

#### **Popular Tools for Local Hosting**

- **Ollama:**  
  A simple command-line tool designed to make running large language models on your own machine easy. With one command (`ollama run llama2`), you can download and interact with models like Llama2, Mistral, and others. Ollama is lightweight and great for experimentation, prototyping, or privacy-focused tasks.

- **LM Studio:**  
  An intuitive desktop application that allows you to download, load, and chat with a variety of open-source LLMs using a visual interface. It eliminates the need to use the command line and is user-friendly, making it accessible for students and non-coders who want to explore local LLMs.

- **KoboldAI:**  
  Particularly popular for creative writing, storytelling, and roleplaying. KoboldAI supports several models and offers a web-based interface for generating stories, dialogue, or game content. It is often used for interactive fiction and creative AI applications.

---

#### **Hardware Requirements**

- **RAM:**  
  At least 8 GB of RAM is recommended to run basic models comfortably. Larger models (6B, 7B, 13B parameters) require more RAM‚Äî16 GB or more is ideal for smooth operation.

- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):**  
  While smaller models can run on a standard CPU, a GPU (like those in gaming laptops or desktops) dramatically increases processing speed and allows you to work with larger, more powerful models. GPU acceleration is especially important for real-time applications or research.

- **Disk Space:**  
  Language models can be large files‚Äîranging from a few gigabytes to dozens of gigabytes. Make sure your computer has enough storage to download and store the models you want to use.

---

#### **Comparison Table: Self-Hosted vs. Cloud/API**

| Feature         | Self-Hosted (Local)         | Cloud/API (Remote)         |
|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Privacy**     | ‚úÖ 100% local, no data leaves your device | ‚ùå Data may be sent, processed, or even logged by the service provider |
| **Setup Effort**| üõ†Ô∏è Higher; requires downloading and installing software, managing updates, and sometimes troubleshooting | üîå Very easy; register and use instantly via web or API |
| **Cost**        | üí∏ One-time expense for hardware, electricity costs; no fees per API call | üí∏ Pay-as-you-go or subscription fees for usage; costs can add up with high usage |
| **Speed**       | ‚ö° Fast, no network latency; instant response if your hardware is good | üåê Depends on internet speed and cloud server load; can be fast but may lag during peak times |

---

**Summary:**  
Self-hosting LLMs empowers you with greater privacy, offline access, and control, but comes with higher initial setup and hardware requirements. It's ideal for sensitive work, custom projects, or learning about how AI models function "under the hood." Cloud APIs, on the other hand, are easy to use and always up-to-date, making them great for rapid development, but may raise privacy or cost concerns for heavy or sensitive usage.

üõ†Ô∏è **Activity:**  
**Live Demo:**  
Show how to run Llama2 locally using Ollama:  
```shell
ollama run llama2
```
Ask the model: ‚ÄúGive me a motivational quote to start my day!‚Äù

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Engineering Basics

### What You‚Äôll Learn

---

#### **What is a Prompt?**

A *prompt* is the message, question, command, or instruction you give to a language model (LLM) to make it generate a response. Think of a prompt as your conversation starter or task description for the AI. The model‚Äôs output will depend heavily on how you phrase this input.

- **Examples:**  
  - Simple: ‚ÄúTell me a joke.‚Äù  
  - Detailed: ‚ÄúWrite a short story about a robot learning to cook, focusing on the robot‚Äôs emotions and challenges.‚Äù  
- **Key Point:**  
  The more clearly you state what you want, the more likely you are to get a useful, relevant, and high-quality answer. Vague prompts often lead to generic, incomplete, or off-topic results.

---

#### **Prompting is Programming**

Prompting is like a new kind of programming‚Äîusing language instead of code.  
- **Traditional programming** requires learning syntax, writing algorithms, and specifying logic step by step.  
- **Prompt engineering** is about using clear, precise language to ‚Äúprogram‚Äù the AI‚Äôs behavior and output.

**Why is this important?**  
- You can ‚Äúteach‚Äù the model to perform a wide variety of tasks‚Äîexplaining concepts, solving problems, generating creative content‚Äîby just phrasing your prompts carefully.
- The better you are at prompt engineering, the more effectively you can use AI for different projects.

---

#### **Writing Effective Prompts**

- **Be Clear and Specific:**  
  Vague prompts leave room for misunderstanding. Instead of ‚ÄúTell me about animals,‚Äù try ‚ÄúList five mammals that live in the ocean.‚Äù This narrows the focus and leads to better answers.

- **Set Context:**  
  Assign the AI a role or scenario for more relevant and accurate responses.
  - *Examples:*
    - ‚ÄúYou are a Java teacher. Explain inheritance to a beginner.‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúYou are a travel agent. Suggest a 3-day trip itinerary for Paris.‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúYou are a nutritionist. Explain why fiber is important.‚Äù

- **Specify Format:**  
  Ask for a particular structure to make the output more usable.
  - *Examples:*
    - ‚ÄúSummarize this article in three bullet points.‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúProvide the answer as a JSON object with keys ‚Äòquestion‚Äô and ‚Äòanswer‚Äô.‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúExplain bubble sort using a step-by-step numbered list.‚Äù

- **Be Goal-Oriented:**  
  Be clear about what you want to achieve.
  - *Example:* ‚ÄúGive me five interview questions for a data analyst role, each with a one-line sample answer.‚Äù

- **Iterate and Refine:**  
  If the first result isn‚Äôt what you wanted, try rewording, adding detail, or breaking the task into steps.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Activity: Prompt Rewriting**

**Exercise:**  
Start with a vague prompt‚Äî**‚ÄúTell me about AI‚Äù**‚Äîand practice turning it into three more effective prompts:

1. **Focused Comparison:**  
   - ‚ÄúExplain the difference between traditional AI and generative AI in simple terms.‚Äù

2. **Application-Based:**  
   - ‚ÄúList three real-world applications of AI in healthcare and briefly describe how they help patients or doctors.‚Äù

3. **Practical Example:**  
   - ‚ÄúDescribe how AI can help automate daily tasks in an office, and give two specific examples.‚Äù

**Bonus:**  
Work in groups to rewrite other vague prompts (like ‚ÄúTell me about India‚Äù or ‚ÄúExplain programming‚Äù), then share and discuss which rewritten prompts lead to better, more useful AI outputs and why.

---

**Summary:**  
Prompt engineering is about asking the right questions, setting the right context, and being clear in your instructions. This ‚Äúsoft programming‚Äù skill is essential for anyone who wants to get the best out of language models, whether for study, work, or creative projects.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Prompting Tips & Tricks

### What You‚Äôll Learn

---

#### **Role Prompting**

Assign the AI a persona or role to get more contextually appropriate answers.  
- **Example:** ‚ÄúYou are a chef. Give me a recipe for biryani.‚Äù  
- **Effect:** The model adopts the language and style of the specified role, making the answer more relevant and engaging.

---

#### **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

Ask the AI to explain its reasoning step by step.  
- **Example:** ‚ÄúExplain how to sort a list using bubble sort, step by step.‚Äù
- **Effect:** The model breaks down the answer into logical, easy-to-follow components‚Äîgreat for educational explanations or troubleshooting.

---

#### **Prompt Templates**

Use reusable ‚Äúscaffolds‚Äù or templates for frequent tasks to save time and ensure consistency.
- **Examples:**
  - ‚ÄúSummarize this article in 3 lines.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúConvert this text into an email.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúExplain this code in simple terms.‚Äù
- **Effect:** Templates help you quickly adapt prompts for different topics or tasks and get predictable, structured outputs.

---

#### **Few-Shot Prompting**

Provide a few examples in your prompt to ‚Äúteach‚Äù the model your desired style, format, or pattern.
- **How it works:**  
  - Give 2-3 input/output pairs as examples, then add a new input and ask the model to continue the pattern.
- **Example:**
  ```
  Convert the following facts into tweets:
  Fact: The honeybee is the only insect that produces food eaten by humans.
  Tweet: Did you know? The honeybee is the only insect that makes food for humans! üçØ #FunFact
  Fact: Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't.
  Tweet: Mind blown! Bananas are technically berries, but strawberries aren't! üçåüçì #DidYouKnow
  Now, convert: Dolphins sleep with one eye open.
  ```
- **Effect:** The model learns from the pattern and generates new outputs in the same style or structure.

---

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Vague or Ambiguous Queries:**  
  ‚ÄúTell me something about AI‚Äù is too broad. Always add context or specific requirements.
- **Conflicting Instructions:**  
  Don‚Äôt ask for two different tones or formats in the same prompt.
- **Overloading the Model:**  
  Don‚Äôt request too much at once (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite a poem, summarize this article, and translate it to Spanish‚Äù). Break large tasks into smaller prompts.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Activity: Design Exercise**

Create a few-shot prompt to convert facts into tweet-sized fun facts.  
**Template Example:**
```
Convert the following facts into tweets:
Fact: The honeybee is the only insect that produces food eaten by humans.
Tweet: Did you know? The honeybee is the only insect that makes food for humans! üçØ #FunFact
Fact: Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't.
Tweet: Mind blown! Bananas are technically berries, but strawberries aren't! üçåüçì #DidYouKnow
Now, convert: Dolphins sleep with one eye open.
```
- **Task:**  
  - Write the prompt as above, adding more example pairs if desired.
  - Swap prompts with classmates and test with an AI tool.
  - Discuss: Which prompt structures led to the best tweets? Why?

---

**Summary:**  
Prompting is an art as much as a science. By mastering different techniques‚Äîlike assigning roles, prompting for step-by-step reasoning, using templates, and few-shot learning‚Äîyou can make language models far more useful, creative, and reliable for any task you tackle.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Good Models vs. Bad Models (Task-Specific)

### What You‚Äôll Learn

---

#### **Model Performance by Task**

Not all AI models are created equal‚Äîsome excel at certain tasks while others may struggle. Understanding which model is best suited for a particular task helps you get the most accurate and efficient results. Below are examples of tasks and the models that typically perform best:

| Task           | Best Model           | Why                                  |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Coding         | **GPT-4, Claude**   | Superior at understanding programming languages, context, and logic. They generate clean, correct, and well-commented code and can debug or explain code accurately. |
| Long Summary   | **Claude**          | Especially good at processing long or complex documents due to its extended context window and ability to keep track of more information. Produces coherent and comprehensive summaries. |
| Privacy Tasks  | **Llama via Ollama**| Runs entirely on your own device‚Äîno cloud involved‚Äîso your data stays private and secure. Ideal for confidential or sensitive tasks. |

**Additional Task Examples:**
- **Creative Writing:** GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude can all produce creative stories, poems, and scripts, but their style and creativity may vary. Try each to see which aligns best with your needs.
- **Translation:** Claude and GPT-4 are strong for high-quality translations, though specialized models like Google Translate may outperform in rare languages.
- **Math & Reasoning:** GPT-4 and Claude are reliable for step-by-step explanations and logical reasoning, but always check outputs for accuracy.

---

#### **Why Some Models Fail**

- **Hallucinations:**  
  Sometimes a language model will ‚Äúmake up‚Äù facts or details that sound convincing but are actually incorrect or imaginary. This is especially common when the prompt asks for very specific or obscure information, or when the model is unsure.

- **Limited Context Window:**  
  Each model can only ‚Äúremember‚Äù or process a certain amount of input at once. If you provide a long document or conversation, older parts may be forgotten. Claude has a larger context window than most, but even it has limits.

- **Overfitting/Underfitting:**  
  - *Overfitting:* The model has learned its training data too well and may repeat or ‚Äúparrot‚Äù examples instead of generalizing.
  - *Underfitting:* The model hasn‚Äôt learned enough patterns and produces generic or irrelevant responses.

- **Other Reasons for Poor Performance:**
  - **Ambiguous Prompts:** If your request isn‚Äôt clear, the model may guess or go off-topic.
  - **Lack of Training Data:** For rare topics or languages, the model might not have enough knowledge.
  - **Model Updates:** Sometimes, new model versions introduce unexpected behaviors‚Äîalways review outputs, especially after updates.

---

#### **How to Choose the Best Model for Your Task**

- **Check Documentation:** Most providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) publish model comparison charts and use-case guides.
- **Experiment:** Try the same prompt in multiple models to compare response quality, style, and accuracy.
- **Evaluate Needs:** For confidential data, prioritize privacy (local models). For speed, try lighter, faster models. For depth and detail, use top-tier LLMs.
- **Stay Updated:** Models evolve rapidly‚Äîtoday‚Äôs best for a task may change as new versions are released.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Activity: Model Comparison**

**Objective:**  
Experience firsthand how different models respond to the same prompt, and learn to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.

**Steps:**
1. **Choose a Prompt:**  
   Example: ‚ÄúSummarize this article in 3 sentences‚Äù or ‚ÄúExplain how a blockchain works to a beginner.‚Äù

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Responsible AI Use

### What You‚Äôll Learn

---

#### **AI is Not Always Right**

- **Limitations of LLMs:**  
  Language models can generate convincing-sounding but factually incorrect, outdated, or misleading information. They may also misunderstand nuanced questions or provide incomplete answers. For example, an LLM might confidently state a scientific ‚Äúfact‚Äù that is actually false or misquote a law or regulation.
- **Best Practice:**  
  Always double-check important outputs‚Äîespecially for academic, professional, or public-facing work‚Äîby consulting textbooks, reputable websites, or experts in the field.

---

#### **Bias in LLMs**

- **What is Bias?**  
  Bias occurs when a model‚Äôs outputs unfairly favor or disadvantage certain groups, perspectives, or topics. This can happen because the data used to train the model contains stereotypes, historical prejudices, or imbalances.
- **Real-World Examples:**  
  - An AI writing tool might generate only male pronouns for doctors and female pronouns for nurses.
  - A model might recommend certain careers or schools to people based on their names or backgrounds.
- **Why It Matters:**  
  Biased outputs can reinforce existing stereotypes, perpetuate unfair treatment, or exclude important voices from discussions.

- **How to Respond:**  
  Be critical of the AI‚Äôs answers. If you spot biased or unfair outputs, revise your prompt, choose another model, or manually correct the result.

---

#### **Legal Considerations**

- **Copyright:**  
  - AI-generated content may use patterns or data from copyrighted works in its training data, raising questions about who owns the output.
  - Some platforms claim ownership over generated content, while others make it public domain or open source. Always check the terms of service.
  - When using AI-generated art or code in your projects, make sure you understand the copyright or licensing rules.

- **Ethics in Academia:**  
  - **Plagiarism Risks:** Directly copying AI-generated answers or essays and submitting them as your own work may be considered academic dishonesty.
  - **Fair Use:** Using AI to assist with brainstorming, summaries, or initial drafts is often acceptable if you clearly state how it was used and do your own critical editing.
  - **Policy Awareness:** Always follow your institution‚Äôs guidelines on the use of AI tools in coursework and exams.

---

#### **Proper Attribution**

- **Why Credit AI?**  
  Acknowledging the use of AI tools is important for honesty, transparency, and academic integrity. It also helps others understand how your work was created.

- **How to Credit:**  
  When sharing or submitting work that was assisted or generated by AI, include a statement such as:  
  _‚ÄúThis project summary was generated using ChatGPT, OpenAI, July 2025.‚Äù_

- **Other Examples:**  
  - ‚ÄúPortions of this code were generated with the help of GitHub Copilot.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúArtwork created using DALL¬∑E 3.‚Äù

---

üõ†Ô∏è **Activity: Debate**

**Debate Topic:**  
‚ÄúShould AI tools be allowed in exams or take-home assignments?‚Äù

- **Instructions:**  
  - Divide the class into two groups: one supports the use of AI, the other opposes it.
  - Each side prepares arguments considering benefits, risks, and ethical implications.
  - Discuss points such as:
    - Does AI level the playing field or create unfair advantages?
    - Does it enhance learning or encourage laziness/plagiarism?
    - How can AI use be monitored or regulated?
    - What skills might students miss out on if they rely too much on AI?
  - After both sides present, hold an open discussion to find common ground or propose guidelines for responsible AI use in education.

---

**Summary:**  
Responsible AI use means understanding both the power and the limitations of language models. Always verify outputs, be alert to bias, respect legal and ethical standards, and credit AI tools in your work. Open discussions and debates help shape fair guidelines for using AI in education and beyond.
