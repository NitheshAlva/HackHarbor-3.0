# Day 6 - Cloud and Hosting

## What is Cloud?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services‚Äîlike servers, storage, and applications‚Äîover the internet. Instead of managing physical hardware, you rent what you need from a cloud provider, paying only for usage.

![Cloud Computing Overview](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3YT0gya2bkUeuMrnGxhjAZ/4146c20c214cf001c74c0868ddfb9503/what-is-the-cloud.png)

### Why Cloud?

- **Scalable**: Grows with your needs
- **Cost-efficient**: No upfront hardware costs
- **Reliable**: High availability and redundancy
- **Accessible**: Use services from anywhere

### Evolution of the Cloud

From personal data centers to shared infrastructure offered by tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, the cloud evolved to solve problems of scale, cost, and speed.

## Cloud Deployment & Service Models

### Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP)
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated for a single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private
- **Community Cloud**: Shared among similar organizations

### Service Models

- **IaaS**: Infrastructure as a Service (e.g., AWS EC2)
- **PaaS**: Platform as a Service (e.g., Firebase)
- **SaaS**: Software as a Service (e.g., Google Docs)

## Practical Cloud Usage

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Storage

Store and retrieve data using:

- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì [S3 Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- **Google Cloud Storage** ‚Äì [GCS Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage)

Use case: File uploads, backups, hosting static files

---

### üíª Virtual Machines

Create servers in the cloud:

- **Amazon EC2** ‚Äì [EC2 Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- **Google Compute Engine** ‚Äì [GCE Docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute)

Use case: Full control over OS and environment

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Serverless Computing

Run backend code without managing servers:

- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì [Lambda Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- **Google Cloud Functions** ‚Äì [GCF Docs](https://cloud.google.com/functions)

Use case: APIs, automation tasks


---

### üì¶ Containers

Package apps and run them anywhere:

- **Docker** ‚Äì [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/)
- **AWS ECS**, **GCP Cloud Run**

Use case: Microservices, reproducible dev environments

---

### üåê Networking Basics

- **DNS**: Converts names to IPs
- **CDN**: Faster content delivery
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across servers

---


## Web Hosting

### üß© What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is a service that allows you to publish your website or web application on the internet. A hosting provider allocates space on a server to store your site's files and make it accessible globally.

### üè† Types of Hosting

1. **Shared Hosting**
   - Share resources like RAM and CPU with many others
   - Cheap, beginner-friendly
   - Slower, limited control
   - e.g., Hostinger, Bluehost

2. **VPS (Virtual Private Server) Hosting**
   - More privacy and dedicated resources
   - Better performance
   - Some technical setup needed
   - e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode

3. **Dedicated Hosting**
   - Entire server dedicated to you
   - Maximum control and performance
   - Expensive, for high-traffic apps
   - e.g., OVH, GoDaddy Dedicated Servers

4. **Cloud Hosting**
   - Runs on multiple servers in the cloud
   - Scalable, highly available
   - Pay-as-you-go
   - e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure

5. **Static Site Hosting**
   - For websites without dynamic content/databases
   - Fast and often free
   - Great for portfolios, blogs
   - e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages

### üßë‚Äçüíª How to Choose a Host

Consider these questions:
- Is my site static or dynamic?
- Do I need a database?
- How much traffic do I expect?
- Do I need backend language support?

---

## Domains, DNS & HTTPS

### üî§ Domain Names & DNS

- **Domain**: The name of your website (e.g., `example.com`)
- **DNS**: Maps domain names to IP addresses

Use services like:

- [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)
- [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)

---

### üîê SSL Certificates & HTTPS

- **HTTPS** encrypts data between the browser and server
- **SSL Certificates** prove your site‚Äôs identity

Free options:

- [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
