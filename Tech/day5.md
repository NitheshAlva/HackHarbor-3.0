# Day 5 - API basics - intro to Postman

# üìò Topic 1: What Are APIs?

## ü§î What is an API?

An **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

It acts as a **messenger** between two software components, allowing them to communicate and exchange data.

> **Real-world analogy**: Think of a restaurant.
>
> * You (the user) sit at a table and order food.
> * The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen.
> * The kitchen (server) prepares the food and sends it back through the waiter (API).

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "API as Waiter Analogy"

- Left: A person sitting at a table holding a menu (User)
- Middle: A waiter labeled "API" taking notes
- Right: A kitchen (Server) preparing food
- Arrow showing flow: User ‚Üí API ‚Üí Server ‚Üí API ‚Üí User
```

---

## üß† Why Are APIs Useful?

* üîÑ **Modularity** ‚Äì Frontend & backend can be built separately
* üß∞ **Reusability** ‚Äì One API can serve multiple apps (mobile, web)
* üîí **Security** ‚Äì Control access to internal data/functions

## üåê Common API Use Cases

| Example App         | API Being Used       |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Weather app         | OpenWeather API      |
| "Login with Google" | Google OAuth API     |
| Google Maps on app  | Google Maps API      |
| ChatGPT chatbot     | OpenAI API           |
| Translate feature   | Google Translate API |

---

## üîå Real API Example (Weather)

üåÄ URL called by a weather app to get current temperature for a city:

```
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Delhi&appid=API_KEY
```

üì¶ The server responds with structured weather data in JSON format.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Weather API Request-Response Flow"

- Browser or App ‚Üí Weather API URL with query param (?q=Delhi)
- Server responds with JSON (temperature, city name, etc.)
- Label key parts: URL, Request, Response, JSON Data
```

---

## üì¨ Real API Example (Social Media Post)

To create a new post on a platform, the frontend might call:

```
POST https://api.myapp.com/posts
Body:
{
  "title": "Hello!",
  "body": "My first post",
  "userId": 7
}
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "POST Request with JSON Body"

- Frontend UI: Form with title & body
- Arrow ‚Üí API endpoint with JSON
- Show the structure of body fields being sent
- Mention Content-Type: application/json
```
---

# üìò Topic 2: REST, HTTP Methods & Status Codes

## üåç What is REST?

**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**. It is an architecture style used for designing networked applications and APIs.

A RESTful API uses **resources**, identified by **URLs**, and standard **HTTP methods** to perform actions on them.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "RESTful API Resource Model"

- Icons representing 'Post', 'User', 'Comment'
- Each resource mapped to a URL like /posts, /users, /comments
- Arrows showing HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operating on them
```

---

## üîÅ HTTP Methods (Verbs)

| Method   | Purpose              | Example Use Case  |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `GET`    | Retrieve data        | View user profile |
| `POST`   | Create new data      | Submit a form     |
| `PUT`    | Update existing data | Edit a blog post  |
| `DELETE` | Remove data          | Delete a comment  |

---

## üß™ Example: Post Resource

| Action          | Method   | URL        |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Get all posts   | `GET`    | `/posts`   |
| Get single post | `GET`    | `/posts/1` |
| Create new post | `POST`   | `/posts`   |
| Update a post   | `PUT`    | `/posts/1` |
| Delete a post   | `DELETE` | `/posts/1` |

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "HTTP Method to Action Mapping"

- REST resource 'Post'
- Lines from each method ‚Üí a different action (like retrieve, create, update, delete)
- Add a sample endpoint for each method (GET /posts/1, etc.)
```

---

## üìü HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning               | Description                          |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 200  | OK                    | Request succeeded                    |
| 201  | Created               | Resource created successfully        |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Invalid or missing input from client |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | Authentication required              |
| 404  | Not Found             | Resource not found                   |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Generic server failure               |

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "HTTP Status Code Chart"

- Green: 2xx Success
- Yellow: 4xx Client Error
- Red: 5xx Server Error
- Include examples like 200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.
```

# üìò Topic 3: Using Postman to Explore APIs Visually

## üß∞ What is Postman?

**Postman** is a popular API client that allows developers to test, debug, and interact with APIs without writing code.

You can send requests like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` and view responses easily ‚Äî great for learning and testing.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Postman Interface Overview"

- Screenshot showing Postman UI
- Highlight: Method dropdown (GET, POST), URL input box, Body tab, and Send button
```

---

## üß™ Try a Simple GET Request in Postman

1. Open Postman
2. Select `GET` from dropdown
3. Paste the URL:

   ```
   https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
   ```
4. Click **Send**

Postman will show a JSON response like:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "...",
  "body": "..."
}
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "GET Request in Postman"

- URL bar filled with JSONPlaceholder URL
- Response panel showing JSON data
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Try a POST Request with JSON Body

1. Select `POST` from method dropdown
2. URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
3. Go to **Body** tab ‚Üí choose **raw** ‚Üí select **JSON** from dropdown
4. Enter this JSON:

```json
{
  "title": "API Demo",
  "body": "Learning APIs with Postman",
  "userId": 1
}
```

5. Click **Send**

You‚Äôll see a response with your submitted data and a new `id`.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "POST Request with Body in Postman"

- Highlight JSON Body tab and dropdown set to `application/json`
- Response showing created resource with `id`
```

---

## üìã Headers to Know

* Most APIs expect a `Content-Type: application/json` header for POST/PUT
* Postman auto-adds this when you choose JSON in the body section

---

## üîç Bonus: Explore Other Test APIs

* `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` ‚Äì Free fake REST API
* `https://reqres.in/` ‚Äì Another great test API for practicing POST/PUT/DELETE

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "API Playground Examples"

- Icons/logos of test APIs (JSONPlaceholder, Reqres)
- Sample endpoints with status tags: GET /users, POST /posts, etc.
```

---

# üìò Topic 4: Understanding JSON Body in API Requests

## üì¶ What is JSON?

**JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.
It is a lightweight data format used to exchange data between a client and a server in a structured and human-readable way.

JSON is commonly used in `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests to send data to the server.

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "age": 21
}
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "JSON Breakdown"

- Visual representation of JSON object
- Highlight keys and values
- Label syntax: quotes, colons, commas
```

---

## üß† JSON vs JavaScript Object

Though they look similar:

* JSON is a **string format**, not code
* All **keys and string values must be in double quotes**
* Cannot contain functions or comments

JavaScript:

```js
{ name: "Alice" } ‚úÖ
```

JSON:

```json
{ "name": "Alice" } ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Using JSON in a POST Request (Postman)

1. Set method to `POST`
2. URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
3. Body tab ‚Üí raw ‚Üí JSON
4. Example body:

```json
{
  "title": "Learning JSON",
  "body": "This is a test post",
  "userId": 99
}
```

5. Send the request

You‚Äôll receive a response echoing your data, with a new `id`.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "POST Request with JSON Body in Postman"

- JSON body section clearly filled
- Headers auto-setting Content-Type
- Response showing the new post with generated ID
```

---

## üìå Content-Type Header

Whenever you send JSON data, you should include this header:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

Postman usually adds this automatically when JSON is selected.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Summary Use Case

Sending a registration form:

```json
{
  "username": "kvlogs",
  "password": "securepass",
  "email": "k@example.com"
}
```

Server can then create a new user with this info.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Frontend Form to JSON"

- Simple form (Username, Password, Email)
- Arrows showing how it's converted to JSON
- JSON sent in body of POST request
```

---

# üìò Topic 5: Using APIs with JavaScript (Fetch API)

## üß† Why Use JavaScript for APIs?

In real-world apps, JavaScript allows your web page to make API requests dynamically ‚Äî without needing to refresh the page.

Most frontend projects use the **Fetch API** to send HTTP requests from JavaScript.

---

## üì¶ Fetching Data from an API (GET Request)

Here‚Äôs how to fetch data from a public API:

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Data received:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Flow of Fetch GET Request"

- Webpage ‚Üí API (GET) ‚Üí JSON Response
- Console logs or shows data on screen
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Sending Data to an API (POST Request)

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'New Post',
    body: 'This post was made using fetch',
    userId: 1
  })
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Created:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Fetch POST Flow"

- Show form ‚Üí JSON.stringify() ‚Üí Fetch with POST ‚Üí API Response
- Highlight headers and body structure
```

---

## üñºÔ∏è Showing API Data on a Webpage (Bonus)

You can update your HTML content using data from an API:

```html
<div id="output"></div>
<script>
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(user => {
    document.getElementById('output').innerText = `Name: ${user.name}`;
  });
</script>
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Live Data Binding"

- Box on webpage showing name loaded via JS
- Show timeline: API ‚Üí JS ‚Üí DOM Update
```

---

## üß™ Tools for Debugging

* Use **browser console** to log request and response
* Check **Network tab** in DevTools to inspect the actual HTTP traffic

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Browser DevTools Network Tab"

- Highlight request URL, status code, response preview
```

---

# üìò Topic 6: Working with API Keys ‚Äì Google AI Studio & OpenWeather

## üîë What is an API Key?

An **API Key** is a unique code used to identify and authorize your access to an API. It's like a password ‚Äî don‚Äôt share it publicly.

Many public APIs (like OpenWeather or Google AI Studio) require you to sign up and get an API key to use their services.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "API Key Concept"

- Lock and key icon
- Label: Client ‚Üí API Key ‚Üí Access Granted
- Warning symbol for public exposure
```

---

## üå¶Ô∏è OpenWeather API ‚Äì Get Weather by City

### üîß Get Your API Key:

1. Go to: [https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign\_up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
2. Sign up & log in
3. Copy your API key from the API Keys section

### üåê Try It in Postman:

```
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Delhi&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### üí° Tip:

* `q` ‚Üí city name
* `appid` ‚Üí your unique key

  const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${key}&units=metric`;

  fetch(url)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      const output = `üå°Ô∏è Temp in ${data.name}: ${data.main.temp}¬∞C`;
      document.getElementById("weather").innerText = output;
    })
    .catch(err => {
      document.getElementById("weather").innerText = "City not found!";
    });
}
```

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Weather Fetch JS Flow"

- Show flow: Input ‚Üí Fetch ‚Üí Response ‚Üí DOM update
- Highlight use of template literals & DOM APIs
```

---

## üß™ Try It Out

1. Save the HTML as `index.html`
2. Save the JS code in `script.js`
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenWeather key
4. Open `index.html` in browser
5. Type a city name and click **Get Weather**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on API Limits

* Free API keys often have rate limits (60 calls/minute for OpenWeather)
* Always handle errors (e.g. wrong city name, no internet, key expired)

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Error Handling Flow"

- Diagram showing 2 branches: Success vs Error
- Display message in UI accordingly
```

---

# üìò Topic 8: Limitations of APIs & Practical Tips

## üöß Common API Limitations

### 1. **Rate Limits**

* Most APIs have a limit on the number of requests per minute/hour.
* Exceeding limits may lead to blocked requests.

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Rate Limiting"

- Graph showing requests per minute
- Warning message: "429 Too Many Requests"
```

---

### 2. **Authentication Requirements**

* Some APIs require OAuth, API Keys, tokens, etc.
* Insecure key usage (like in frontend code) can expose your API.

---

### 3. **CORS Restrictions**

* Some APIs block frontend requests from different origins (browser security).
* Error: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` missing

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "CORS Error Explained"

- Diagram: Browser ‚Üí API (blocked)
- Error message: "CORS Policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'..."
```

---

### 4. **Unreliable or Inconsistent APIs**

* Free/test APIs may change response format or go down.
* Always check API documentation.

---

## üí° Best Practices for Working with APIs

* ‚úÖ Always read official documentation
* ‚úÖ Use Postman to test before coding
* ‚úÖ Handle errors (`.catch()`, 404s, invalid inputs)
* ‚úÖ Respect rate limits and retry if necessary
* ‚úÖ Store keys securely (use `.env`, don‚Äôt push to GitHub)
* ‚úÖ Test with known working inputs before dynamic data

```
üì∑ Image Suggestion: "Do's and Don'ts of API Usage"

- Column split with green ticks and red crosses
- Examples: Use .env ‚úÖ, Hardcode key ‚ùå, Test first ‚úÖ, Assume success ‚ùå
```
