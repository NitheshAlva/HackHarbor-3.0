<!-- Course content goes here -->

## Open Source

## 1. What is Open Source?

* **Definition:**
  
  Open source is software that anyone can view, use, modify, and distribute. Its source code is publicly available.

* **Real-World Examples:**
  
  Linux, VS Code, Mozilla Firefox, React, Python, Blender.

* **Benefits of Open Source:**

  * Learn by reading real code
  * Build your portfolio
  * Collaborate with global developers
  * Help others and get help
  * Build credibility and network
    
**Analogy:**
Think of open source like Wikipedia: anyone can read it, contribute to it, and make it better for everyone.

## 2. How Open Source Works

* **The GitHub Ecosystem:**

  * **Repositories** = Project folders
  * **Commits** = Snapshots of changes
  * **Branches** = Safe spaces to work on features
  * **Issues** = To-do list or bug tracker
  * **Pull Requests (PRs)** = Proposals for merging code
  * **Forks** = Your own copy of a public project

* **Typical Contribution Flow:**

```
1. Fork a repository
2. Clone it to your computer
3. Create a new branch
4. Make changes
5. Commit & push changes
6. Create a Pull Request
```
